To find the most small distance pair of points among 10 time series data using DTW, you can use a pairwise distance matrix to compare each time series with every other time series, and then find the minimum distance pair.

Here's an example Python code that uses the `fastdtw` function from the `fastdtw` library to compute the DTW distance between each pair of time series, and then finds the minimum distance pair:

In this code, we define 10 example time series `x1` through `x10`. We then use a nested loop to compute the pairwise distance matrix between all combinations of time series using the `fastdtw` function from the `fastdtw` library. The `distance_matrix` variable is a symmetric matrix that stores the pairwise DTW distances between all time series.

We then find the minimum distance pair by first finding the minimum non-zero distance in the `distance_matrix`, and then using the `argwhere` function to find the indices of the minimum distance pair. Finally, we output the minimum distance pair and their distance.

Note that this code assumes that all time series have the same length and that their indices in the `data` list correspond to their row and column indices in the `distance_matrix`. If your time series have different lengths or are stored in a different format, you may need to modify the code accordingly.

Yes, there are several ways to visualize a pairwise distance matrix in Python. One common approach is to use a heatmap, where the color of each cell in the matrix corresponds to the value of the distance between the corresponding pair of time series.

Here's an example code that uses the seaborn library to create a heatmap of the pairwise distance matrix:

In this code, we first compute the pairwise distance matrix distance_matrix using the fastdtw function, as described in the previous answer. We then use the seaborn library to create a heatmap of the matrix, using the heatmap function. The cmap parameter specifies the color map to use, and plt.show() displays the plot.

When you run this code, you should see a heatmap that shows the pairwise distances between each pair of time series, with darker colors indicating smaller distances and lighter colors indicating larger distances. The diagonal of the matrix should be zero, since each time series is identical to itself and has zero distance.

DEPRECATION: fastdtw is being installed using the legacy 'setup.py install' method, because it does not have a 'pyproject.toml' and the 'wheel' package is not installed. pip 23.1 will enforce this behavior change. A possible replacement is to enable the '--use-pep517' option. Discussion can be found at https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8559

Certainly! Here's an example Python code that uses the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to identify the dominant frequencies in a time series, which can be used to determine the seasonality of the data:

In this example, we generate a time series with a daily and weekly seasonal pattern, and add some random noise to simulate real-world data. We then compute the FFT and power spectrum of the time series, and plot the power spectrum to visualize the dominant frequencies. Finally, we identify the top 5 frequencies with the highest power, and compute the corresponding seasonal periods. In this case, the output should show that the dominant frequencies correspond to a daily period of 24 hours and a weekly period of 168 hours (1 week), which confirms the presence of daily and weekly seasonality in the data.

"""_summary_
To interpolate time series data that is sampled at a lower frequency (e.g., every 5 or 15 minutes) to a higher frequency (e.g., every 1 minute), you can use various interpolation techniques. One common interpolation method is linear interpolation, which estimates the missing values by drawing a straight line between the neighboring data points.

Here's an example Python code that uses the `pandas` library to interpolate time series data that is sampled every 5 minutes to a higher frequency of every 1 minute using linear interpolation:

In this code, we first generate an example time series data `ts` that is sampled every 5 minutes, using the `np.random.randint` function to generate random integer values between 10 and 20. We then use the `pd.date_range` function to create a datetime index that spans 5 periods, starting from January 1, 2022, and sampled every 5 minutes. We create a Pandas Series object `ts` by passing the data and index to the `pd.Series` function.

We then use the `resample` method to resample the time series data to a higher frequency of every 1 minute, using the '1min' frequency string. The `interpolate` method is used to fill in the missing values using linear interpolation, specified by the `method='linear'` parameter.

Finally, we print the original and interpolated time series data using the `print` function. The interpolated time series data `ts_interpolated` should have 4 times as many data points as the original data `ts`, with the missing values filled in using linear interpolation.

Note that there are other interpolation methods available in `pandas`, such as cubic interpolation and polynomial interpolation, which may be more appropriate for different types of data. The `interpolate` method also has other parameters that can be used to customize the interpolation behavior, such as the `limit` parameter to limit the number of consecutive NaN values that can be interpolated.
